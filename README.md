# Troll Mountains - Project Exam 1

![image](https://roarfh-portifolio.netlify.app/images/exProject.png)

This project was my exam project for the year. I had to create a WordPress blog and fetch the content from the blogs API to my website. I had to include an image carousel for the main images in each blogpost and make them clickable to go to the content pages.

## Description

I started with the design job in Figma to find out how my website should look and what each page should contain.

Next was setting up an WordPress blog for my blogposts and fill it with some blogposts. I started with 9 blog posts.

In JavaScript my job was now to fetch the blog post content from the API from my WordPress blog.

I run into several problems during the process.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Create and clone the repo:

I got a new repo on Noroff's GitHub and cloned it to local. Then I added a new site on Netlify.com and connected to my repo.

The next step was to copy my files from the first project (same site, that I should modify now). THen I had to commit and push the files in GitHub.

2. Install the dependencies:

Then I started creating a WordPress installation on my private server.

I installed the woocommerce plugin to my WordPress installation to make get the webshop-features and uploded images and all the information needed.

After doing this I had to get the API from my WordPress installation. Once I succeed with that I started fetching the content from the API using JavaScript.

Then I had to do some work in my HTML to remove the hardcoded images and information and make the HTML ready to receive the information from the API through the JavaScript files.
